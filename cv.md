## About me ##
At that time I was 32 years old.
I consider myself an adult enough guy to change profession, but as it is.
I am taking software engineering courses at a private educational institution, where, in principle, after
passing the first year exams with excellent marks, I received an invitation to work.
At the moment, there are no hobbies, except for everyday life and study, but I am not the only one, every
student experiences this.
I am optimistic about the future, I believe that I can get a position as a developer,
thereby improving my quality of life and meeting your daily needs.

###### About IT ######
Why did I choose THIS?
First, I loved computers for a very long time.
Until the age of 30, the goal was not to change profession, my environment changed and sooner or later you will
begin to acquire other people's habits.
